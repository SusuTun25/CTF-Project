      description="Agent, we've located several critical systems within The Phantom Collective's infrastructure. 
      These systems are running vulnerable software, but exploiting them requires precise manipulation of memory and code execution. 
      Your mission is to find and exploit these vulnerabilities, gain unauthorized access, and take control of their systems. 
      You'll need to master buffer overflows, shellcode injection, and other low-level exploitation techniques. 
      Each system you compromise weakens their defenses and brings us closer to shutting down their operation. 
      The cyber battlefield awaits â€“ are you ready to become the ultimate System Hacker?"
